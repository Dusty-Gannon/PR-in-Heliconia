### E.1 

 > Is there literature on the pollinator efficiencies of visitors to these taxa? Or, more general information about whether pollinators with mismatched bill shapes are typically less efficient pollinators?

* [ ] Addressed in lines ...

**Notes**

* *H. rostrata*

  - Janecek et al. 2020, South Africa
  
    - Some visits from olive sunbird (*Cyanomitra olivacea*) and Camaroon sunbird (*Cyanomitra oritis*), but **no pollen tubes**. This documents poor pollinator efficiencies outside the native range. They do claim this could be morphological filtering.


  
### E.2

 > Which taxa are primary visitors of these *Heliconia* species in the wild?

* [ ] Addressed in lines ...

**Notes**

* *H. hirsuta*

  - Snow and Snow (1972)

    - green hermits and rufous-breasted hermits (*Glaucis hirsutus*)

* *H. tortosa*

  - Betts et al. (2015)

    - *H. tortuosa* pollen is carried by six hummingbirds, indicating more than just hermits visit.

  - Linhart 1973, La Selva
    - Primarily Phaethorninae, but also forked-tail woodnymph (*Thalurania furcata*)

  - Taylor and White (2007), Costa Rica

    - Euglossine bees, sabrewings, and green hermits
    
* *H. rostrata*

  - Janecek et al. 2020, South Africa
  
    - Some visits from olive sunbird (*Cyanomitra olivacea*) and Camaroon sunbird (*Cyanomitra oritis*) in Africa (not native range).

  - Sazima et al. (1995), Brazil (not native range)

    - Saw-billed hermit (*Ramphodon naevius*), which has a straight bill. 

* *H. wagneriana*

    - Stiles (1975), Costa Rica

        - 49/51 (96.1%) of visits to *H. wagneriana* were by hermits (*Phaethornis superciliosus, Threnetes ruckeri,* and *Glaucis hirsuta*). 2 visits were by rufous-tails.

    - Gannon et al. (2018)

        - Mostly sabrewings, with a few green hermits

    - Temeles and Bishop (2019)

        - Mostly female purple-throated caribs, but males after the hurricane

### 1.1

 > The finding that hand pollinations resulted in fewer pollen tubes than naturally outcrossed flowers exposed to hummingbird visits is not necessarily evidence of pollinator recognition. Rather, it indicates that something about hand pollination does not duplicate the natural pollination process, which beyond the hummingbird itself, could depend upon the timing of the pollinator visit in relation to the life of the flower, the number of hummingbird visits, or nectar removal.

### 1.2

 > Nectar removal seems the most likely explanation, and was the explanation offered by Betts et al. 2015. Yet in the current study, hand pollination plus nectar removing using a pipettor did not enhance pollen tube growth, thereby mimicking the results for natural hummingbird pollinators.  Possibly, bills or tongues be doing something mechanical inside the flower, such as pushing and relocating the staminode, or triggering something physiological in the nectar chamber. Alternatively, methods of this study may have differed from those in Betts et al., yet it is unclear how or why they would, given that removing nectar with a pipettor and hand-pollinating flowers are pretty straight forward methods. The inconsistent results call into question pollinator recognition and raise issues about methods and/or the genetics of the plants used in the experiments.

  **Notes**
  
* I would argue that these issues only call into question the *mechanism* of PR, considering that we used the same plants in the aviaries and found increased pollen tube rates following bird visits. It should therefore not call PR into question in general or raise issues about the methods/genetics.

### 1.3  

 > To what extent might the low number of pollen tubes result from using experimental plants derived from the same genetic stock? Which species were ornamentals, which species were naturalized, and which species were native? Garden or naturalized plants might have low genetic diversity or may have been selected through the breeding process for low reproductive output. Did you check these plants to see whether they were in fact setting fruits and seeds?

1.4

 > How many plants and flowers of each Heliconia species were used in the aviary experiments? In addition, how many birds of each bill morphology were used in these experiments? More precisely, readers need to know the number of experimental units for each Heliconia species x experimental trial treatment.

* [ ] Sample sizes added to figures

1.5

 > How were the aviaries constructed? Were you actually building them around live inflorescences of natural plants? Can you provide a photograph in an appendix?

* [ ] Addressed in lines ...

1.6

 > Do you have any idea on the frequency of visits by hummingbirds to your plants and flowers in the free-ranging pollination experiments depicted in Figure 1? Was the same flower getting visited more than once? (lines 108-117)

1.7

 > It would be nice to know the number of pollen grains deposited on a stigma both for hand pollinations, open-pollinations (Fig. 1), and following visits by birds to hand-pollinated flowers. Having this information might help elucidate pollination mechanisms
 
* [ ] Addressed in lines ...

**Thoughts**

* This simply does not seem feasible, especially if we also want to quantify pollen tubes in the same flower. 

1.8 

 > Similarly, it would be nice to know the degree to which pollen tubes translate into seeds.
 
* [ ] Addressed in lines ...

**Thoughts**

* This is simply not going to happen with the data we have.

1.9 

 > The mean number of pollen tubes in this experiment is exceedingly small (0 to 1). One would think with hand pollination that one would get maximum pollen tube growth, but that doesn't happen, which makes Heliconias so interesting. I'd be interested to know whether the number of pollen tubes increases with the number of natural visits by hummingbirds (as well as pollen donors).

 >  I also wonder whether the low mean number of pollen tubes and the design of the study makes it difficult to detect differences, if they exist.

 * I think this could be happening with *H. rostrata*.
 
1.11

 > Did birds remove nectar from flowers in the field and aviary experiments, and if so, how much?
 
* [ ] Addressed in lines ...

**Thoughts**

* I think we already cover why we don't have data on this, but we could add that they do remove at least some nectar which we can back up with the videos where one can clearly see the birds drinking.

### 1.12 

 > ...while short-billed hummingbirds may be able to remove a small amount of nectar from the flowers of this plant in aviary experiments, they may not be major visitors to this plant in native systems due to competitive exclusion by long-billed hummingbird species that are more effective nectar removers. This has major implications for the pollinator recognition hypothesis as a pollinator filter, because it would suggest that competition with other hummingbird species is the filter, not within-the-tube pollinator recognition as implied by Betts et al. 2015.

2.2

 > 85 - I think it would be important to add ideas about purity of pollen loads pollinators carry - would you expect those to differ (i.e. precision in size matching, deposition on safe sites, depositing on different areas of the pollinators bodyâ€¦) - you cited Muchhala before, so this would tie in easily here

2.3 

 > 132f - as it is written now, it is hard to follow all the different experiments you have done; I suggest you break this long paragraph into smaller paragraphs and include details on sample sizes (species, how many individuals per species) in each paragraph; also, I saw that you have longer experimental procedures as supplement, but I didn't see them being cited in the text? Anyways, I would suggest you include some more details still in the main text so that the reader can more easily understand what experiments you conducted.

2.4 

 > 138 - how did you standardize quantity? This may still differ, no matter whether the pollen came from the same donor. Also, there is no explanation of how you applied the pollen to the stigmas. Furthermore, you do not specify anywhere whether flowers were emasculated before? If not, how can you rule out that pollinators did not remove pollen grains when visiting?

2.5

 > 146 - could hummingbirds dislodge pollen grains from the stigmas when visiting?

2.7

 > 159 - I do not fully see how this test really allows you to control for potential pollen-rearrangement by hummingbirds. The surface of a pipette tip is different from feathers (i.e. even more electrostatically charged); is it possible to insert the pipette tip into the flower in the same angle/way a hummingbird would insert its bill?

**Thoughts**

* Adam's "real bird" trials

2.8

 > 253 - is there any previous experimental evidence whether the different hummingbird species differ in their pollination efficiency under natural conditions (i.e. visitation frequency and seed set)? This would be important information to add here in order to judge the relevance of your finding, i.e. whether increased pollen germination following the visit of a specific species may actually occur naturally.

2.9

 > 273 - I think this is information that should come earlier, i.e. whether the different Heliconia species differ in flower size and may hence be expected to be adapted to a certain subgroup of hummingbirds

2.10

 > 308 - did you study H. tortuosa at the same locality in both studies? Could it be that it is adapted to different pollinator subsets in different populations?

* [ ] Addressed in lines ...

**Thoughts**

* I really do not see how this is relevant considering that the results from bird trials are consistent.
