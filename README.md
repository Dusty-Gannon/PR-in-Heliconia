# Testing for pollinator recognition in *Heliconia*

Partner redundancy increases the robustness of plant-pollinator communities to extinctions of mutualistic partners. However, selection may reinforce floral traits that filter pollinator communities to promote pollination by efficient pollinators, reducing redundancy. This repository documents the analysis of data collected from experiments designed to test the generality of a recently described, cryptic pollinator filter termed ‘pollinator recognition’ (PR) by [Betts et al. (2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273156439_Pollinator_recognition_by_a_keystone_tropical_plant). Pollinator recognition was first documented in *Heliconia tortuosa* on the grounds that with pollen quality experimentally held constant, pollen tube germination occurred following visits from some hummingbird species but not others. Such a cryptic pollinator filter  could drastically reduce the realized number of pollinators compared to the number of floral visitors. We assessed the prevalence of PR in four taxa spread widely across the Heliconiaceae. 

With aviary experiments that standardized pollen quality and minimized variation in pollen quantity, we demonstrated that visits by pollen-free hummingbirds with bill morphologies that match the flower morphology increased pollen tube rates compared to hand pollination in two species; we also corroborated previous results that visits by long-billed, but not short-billed hummingbirds increased pollen tubes in H. tortuosa. While the mechanism remains equivocal, cryptic pollinator filters could be more common than previously anticipated and could alter perspectives on redundancy in plant-pollinator communities.
